# source-cmd

A Windows Command Promptâ€“style console built with Qt, inspired by the **Source Engine** developer console.
Designed primarily for Windows (uses `cmd.exe`), with basic support for Linux/macOS using `bash`.

Currently, only the **Windows** release is available to download, **Linux/macOS** users need to build the program themselves.


## Features

- Execute system commands without opening an external terminal.
- Output displayed immediately in the console window.
- Clear console with `clear` or `clr` commands.
- Scrollable, selectable text output.
- Cross-platform command execution.
- Closely replicates Source Engine's console style.
  
Note: Some features, such as text color changing, are currently not supported. You also might experience freezes and crashes.




**Version 1.1**
